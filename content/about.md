### Contact

Hey, we love feedback. Join the mailing list, Slack channel or just drop us
an email to tell us why this is crap (or not?).

- [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/mod_swift)
- [Slack](http://slack.noze.io)
- [info@mod-swift.org](mailto:info@mod-swift.org)


### Status

- *Not for production*. Consider the version numbers.

- We chose the traditional Swift approach:
  Make something barely usable, though demoable,
  and release it with a 3.0 version tag.
  Then hope that the community kicks in and fills open spots.

- It already has leftpad.

- Implements primarily the happy path. Errors will error. Presumably this
  will improve over time.
